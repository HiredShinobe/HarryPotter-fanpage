The following Harry Potter Fandom pages are created as a way of showcasing my HTML, CSS and JS skills. As I learn more and find newer methods of writing DRY code, I will build on the project and add what I see appropriate to it. Every page will be focused on a new concept.

As a side note, I first became interested in coding when I felt it is the closest we will ever get to magic. I never received my Hogwarts letter and I suppose I can't create my own potions and spells, but perhaps I can learn how to solve real world problems by learning how to code like a pro!
