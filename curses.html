      <p><em>"Now. . . those three curses - Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus - are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That's what you're up against. That's what I've got to teach you to fight. You need preparing. You need arming. But most of all, you need to practise constant, never-ceasing vigilance. Get out your quills. . . copy this down. . . .""

      There have been situations where such curses have been used and have gone without punishment.

          Soon after being "cruciated" by Harry, Amycus Carrow was also subject to an Imperius Curse cast by Minerva McGonagall.

          Shortly before the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry not only successfully used the Cruciatus Curse against Amycus Carrow, he also cast the Imperius Curse against two individuals during the Gringotts heist which led to Harry, Hermione, and Ron getting in the Lestrange vault.

          When Harry tries to inflict this curse on Bellatrix, she lets him know that, in order for it to work properly, he must truly hate them and enjoy the pain he is causing that individual. Harry feels the effects of this curse himself when Voldemort hits him with the spell after the final maze during the Triwizard Tournament. He describes the sensation as, "feeling like his head was being split open while having his bones set on fire."

      These three curses have been classified as"Unforgivable" in Wizarding society since 1717 according to Albus Dumbledore.
  During the First Wizarding War the Death Eaters made frequent use of these curses and in an effort to even things out, the Ministry of Magic gave Aurors special permission to use them as well.</p><p>After the First Wizarding War ended with the disappearance of Lord Voldemort, Alice and Frank Longbottom were tortured into insanity with the Cruciatus Curse by four Death Eaters. This crime was considered by many to be one of the most horrific crimes in living memory. The victims never recovered and spent the rest of their lives in the Janus Thickey Ward for irrevocable spell damage at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.</p>
      <p>
        During the Second Wizarding War the Unforgivable Curses were made legal by Lord Voldemort, after he and his Death Eaters successfully infiltrated and usurped the British Ministry of Magic.After the war ended, this was reversed by Kingsley Shacklebolt, when he became Minister for Magic.

     <p> Since the Unforgivable Curses are very powerful, their use requires both great willpower and great skill in order to bring about the effects. One must also have a desire to use the curses for malevolent purposes.For example, Harry Potter was unable to effectively cast the Cruciatus Curse on Bellatrix Lestrange in 1996. Despite being furious with her for her murder of his godfather, he lacked the desire to cause pain for its own sake. Harry's "righteous anger" only inflicted a brief moment of pain on her.</p>

  Shortly before the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry not only successfully used the Cruciatus Curse against Amycus Carrow, he also cast the Imperius Curse against two individuals during the Gringotts heist which led to Harry, Hermione, and Ron getting in the Lestrange vault.Soon after being "cruciated" by Harry, Amycus Carrow was also subject to an Imperius Curse cast by Minerva McGonagall. Perhaps because the curses were cast during a period when the ban on their use had been lifted, there is no indication of either Harry or McGonagall being punished for using them in these circumstances.</p>

         The Unforgivable Curses in Harry Potter are some of the most powerful and dangerous spells of the Dark Arts, and were classified as “unforgivable” in 1717. The use of any of these on another human, whether muggle or wizard, was punished with a life sentence in Azkaban, but that never stopped Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters from using them constantly. In order to successfully use any of them, the caster must have great willpower, skill, and desire to use them for malevolent purposes. The Cruciatus Curse (crucio) is used for torturing, as it inflicts excruciating pain on the recipient, and the damage depends on the desires and purposes of the caster. The pain can be such that it can kill, cause amnesia, or drive the person to madness, which is what happened to Alice and Frank Longbottom at the hands of Barty Crouch Jr, Rodolphus, Rabastan, and Bellatrix Lestrange.

    <p><strong>Description: Causes instant and painless death.</strong><br>

          First, you must hold your wand slightly-not far- into the air. Then you must slowly lower your wand and say the incantation clearly. If you move the wand too fast when casting the Avada Kedavra curse, there could be some major side-effects.        
        </code>
        <br><br>
  <p>The incantation of Avada Kedavra causes a blindingly intense green bolt of light to shoot from the end of the caster's wand, which, on contact with the victim, results in instant death. There are no secondary effects; the victim simply "drops dead" for no biological reason. <br>It is possible that the victim's internal organs cease function. However, it seems to be more likely that the method of killing is due to the soul of the victim being magically ripped from their body. Evidence for this comes from the testimony of perhaps its most prolific caster; Lord Voldemort. Having experienced the lethal effects of a rebounded Killing Curse but surviving due to his creation of multiple Horcruxes, Voldemort described the sensation of being struck by it as having his consciousness torn from his body, accompanied by a sensation which he described as being "pain beyond pain". Muggle coroners would be unable to find a cause of death in such an attack,[19] but the Ministry of Magic recognises the signs of the curse.</p>
  <p>
  The Killing Curse has no counter-curse and cannot be blocked by most magical means. However, the green energy bolt may be dodged, blocked with solid objects or intercepted with a few other powerful fast spells, particularly Stunning spells. For instance, Albus Dumbledore enchanted a statue from the Fountain of Magical Brethren to shield Harry Potter from Voldemort's Killing Curse during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. If the curse misses the victim and strikes an inanimate object instead, it may cause a small explosion at the point of impact results, which may start a fire of green flame. However, the curse may also ricochet off the object in question.</p>

      <p><strong>Description: Inflicts excruciating pain on the recipient of the curse (tortures them).</strong><br>
        <img class="curses-img"src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bb/d3/af/bbd3afb08a2734da7f58ff6352d75e21.png" alt=""><br>

          The Cruciatus Curse (Crucio), also known as the Torture Curse, was a tool of the Dark Arts and one of the three Unforgivable Curses. It was one of the most powerful and sinister spells known to Wizardkind. When cast successfully the curse inflicted intense, excruciating pain on the victim.        
        </code>
        <br><br>
  <p>The Cruciatus Curse, which inflicts excruciating pain upon the victim, requires the verbal incantation and the use of a wand.[1] The effects of the curse depend upon the desires and emotions of the character — to produce the excruciating pain implied by the name, the caster must, according to accomplished caster Bellatrix Lestrange, truly despise the victim and to enjoy causing pain. The extreme pain inflicted by the curse makes it uniquely suited as a form of torture, and was used regularly by the Death Eaters.</p><p>
  
  When Harry Potter was made the victim of the curse in June 1995, he described it as feeling like his head was being split open while having his bones set on fire. However, since this is the only time Harry is known to have been inflicted with the Curse, and as no one else has ever given a description of its effects, it is unknown if this is how the Curse always feels.</p><p>
  
  The Cruciatus Curse caused Alice and Frank Longbottom such suffering that they were admitted to the permanent ward at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries as cases of insanity. This was carried out by: Barty Crouch Jr, Bellatrix Lestrange, Rodolphus Lestrange, and Rabastan Lestrange. This act is considered one of the most depraved crimes of all time, in terms of damage to the victim and the sadism of their attackers.

      <p>
        <strong>Description: Causes the victim to perform the unquestioned bidding of the caster.</strong><br><img class="curses-img"src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/13/c1/35/13c13524a4b8afbf2322be1afb195fe5.png" alt=""><br>

          Casting the curse itself is not as difficult as the other two Unforgivables. Basically all you have to do is point your wand at the inferior being (muggle or wizard, the point is that they are ALWAYS inferior beings compared to yourself, keep that in mind) and chant the incantation, Imperio (pronounced Imp-EH-ree-oh.        
        </code>
        <br><br>
  <p>The Imperius Curse places the victim in a trance or dreamlike state, an experience is described as a "wonderful release" from any sense of responsibility, making the victim under its power profoundly susceptible to the influence of the caster, whose hold on their free will is deeply rooted in part by the victim's unwillingness to impart with the comfortable sensation and in part by their newfound lack (and thus indifference to) the moral perspective of the caster's desires, making the victim inclined to carry out whatever task thrust upon them for no other reason than that they fail to see why they should not do so, leaving him or her largely under the complete control of the caster.
      </p><p>
  The victim is calm, from doing things they would be physically incapable of otherwise, to committing horrible crimes, and they obey any order. It is also seen that the curse works on animals, as Barty Crouch Jr cast the Imperius Curse on a spider during class when disguised as Alastor Moody.
  </p>
  Death Eaters often made use of this curse; for instance, in forcing Broderick Bode and Sturgis Podmore to try to steal a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries[28] and to place several officials under their control to facilitate their take-over of the Ministry of Magic in 1997. Many Death Eaters also claimed to be under the Imperius Curse during the First Wizarding War to avoid imprisonment in Azkaban.
  <p>
  Resisting the Imperius Curse is possible, but extremely difficult. Only those of a particularly strong will can achieve it. Harry Potter, Barty Crouch Snr, and Barty Crouch Jr each learned to resist the curse after being subjected to its effects. Harry Potter in particular appeared to be extraordinarily good at this, as he was able to partially resist the curse from the very first time it was ever cast upon him, and he was later able to completely resist it when it was cast upon him by Voldemort himself.
